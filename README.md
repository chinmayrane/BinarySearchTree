# BinarySearchTree

Implementation of Binary Search Tree in C++ using Templates

1. searchNode

2. deleteNode

3. insertNode

4. print

print function works in preorder traversal, it can be modified to inorder and postorder format easily by changing the order of visiting the nodes.

Binary Search Tree cannot be symmetric cause left and right child need to have lower and higher values than the root everytime, the mirroring property goes null and void due to this.

Binary Tree can be symmetric as no restriction on the left and right sub trees.
